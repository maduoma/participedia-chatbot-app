been growing between those in favor of changing the law to introduce active assistance in
dying and those who do not want france to move beyond the current law.1 under the 2016
claeys-leonetti law, terminally ill patients can request to be kept in a “deep, continuous
sedation altering consciousness until death,” only if their condition causes ""great suffering""
and is likely to lead to a quick death. euthanasia is currently legal in the netherlands,
belgium, luxembourg, and spain under certain conditions. in switzerland, assisted suicide is
allowed where the patient takes a lethal dose of drugs themselves. every year, french
patients travel to these european countries in pursuit of options to end their life.
on september 13, 2022, president macron announced the launch of a national debate to
explore the possibility of legalizing end-of-life support. the prime minister, elizabeth borne,
followed this announcement with a letter addressed to thierry beaudet, president of the
conseil économique, social et environnemental (cese), requesting a citizens’ convention on
the end of life (convention citoyenne sur la fin de vie, or ccfv) to engage with french
citizens and to enrich the national debate on this subject.
a 2021 law adopted following the first french citizens’ convention for the climate (ccc),

13344,"the gilets jaunes protests, macron’s democratic experiment, and deliberative mini publics","against this backdrop of waning political legitimacy, the government announced an increase in fuel taxes in november 2018 to help curtail carbon emissions. the ratio of tax to gross domestic product (gdp) in france has historically been one of the highest of the member countries of the organization for economic co-operation and development (oecd). for instance, france’s tax revenues for 2019 represented 45.5 percent of gdp. after the announcement, a petition posted online several months
earlier—calling for a reduction in fuel prices—spread with great speed and morphed into a series of widespread demonstrations across france. protesters leading these demonstrations rejected the support of unions and political parties, instead insisting that politics should be conducted by and for ordinary people. initially, their demands were aligned with macron’s campaign promises: lower taxes, greater
purchasing power, and a better democracy. but they did not predict the macron government would fulfill these promises since lower taxes meant the abolition of the wealth tax for the top 1 percent, a campaign promise macron had quickly pushed through, while the fuel-tax announcement was a tax increase for the most vulnerable populations—those who cannot afford to live in urban centers and are highly
dependent on their vehicles. the movement became known as gilets jaunes, or
“yellow vests,” because the protesters wore fluorescent yellow jackets that french law requires all motorists to carry in their cars. a true populist movement, the gilets
jaunes were structureless, leaderless, and highly volatile. the movement, soon joined by ultra-left anarchists and far-right agitators, turned against macron and the french political establishment. referring to the eighteenth-century bread riots that fomented the french revolution, the head of polling for the ifop remarked that the price of fuel was as politically and sociologically sensitive as the price of
wheat was in the days of the ancien régime.",https://participedia.net/case/13344
13347,citizens assemblies: the democracy upgrade,"imagine this: for years your city’s been grappling with homelessness, but nothing’s worked. in fact, it’s gotten worse. folks are divided, angry, and fed up. finally, officials decide to try something new. a group of everyday people from all walks of life is chosen by democratic lottery—and you are among those selected.

over several weeks, you hear from scholarly experts, social workers, police officers, community advocates, local businesspeople, and residents who’ve experienced homelessness. you have respectful conversations about what you’ve learned; you listen to each other, weigh trade-offs, and offer reasons for your thinking. finally, you come to a rough consensus about what to do.

your proposals balance head and heart: investments in affordable housing; mental health services; public safety; law enforcement; drug rehab; and job programs. best of all, you’re in broad agreement, giving officials a sound basis to act. it takes time, but gradually things improve. homeless residents receive the services they need. crime falls. and the community heals. the government, buoyed by the process, repeats it on other issues. as more and more residents take their turn serving, the city becomes a place where all belong and everyone has a voice.

sound far-fetched? it’s real. the process described above is called a citizens' assembly, and it’s transforming the world.",https://participedia.net/case/13347
13349,when will the united states start taking citizens’ assemblies seriously?,"last year, a headline in the guardian asked a provocative question: “citizens’ assemblies: are they the future of democracy?” 

it’s a reflection of just how popular this approach to democracy has become in many parts of the (mostly western) world. citizens’ assemblies are random collections of people, selected by lottery from the general population, usually convened to deliberate on a specific policy question. there are currently hundreds of citizens assemblies running at the national, state or local level, from paris’ permanent citizens council, to germany’s many regional assemblies, to the increasing number of deliberative bodies forming across latin america.

yet, the vast majority of innovation around deliberative democracy is in europe and canada, with comparatively little in the united states, the world’s second largest democracy. why is that? 

it’s certainly not because people in the united states are satisfied with the voice they have in decision-making. two years ago, a survey found that 83% of voters believe there isn’t “an adequate system in place for the voice of the american people to be heard in congress.” and when presented with the prospect of a politician who says they will consult with a representative sample of constituents to decide their stance, more than 4 in 10 said they would cross party lines to vote for such a person.so, what’s going on? why haven’t citizens’ assemblies taken root in the united states in the same way as participatory budgeting?
